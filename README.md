# TENSORFLOW-REGRESSION-AND-CLASSIFICATION
# Neural Network Projects: Classification, Regression & Practice

This repository is part of my data science portfolio and contains a collection of neural network projects implemented using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. It includes:

- A pre-trained model (`best_model.h5`)
- Notebooks demonstrating neural network-based classification and regression tasks
- A practice notebook for experimental code and further exploration

## Repository Structure

Usage
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open and run the notebooks (Neural_Network_Classification.ipynb, Neural_Network_Regression.ipynb, and Practice_1.ipynb) sequentially to view the code, training processes, and evaluations.

Load the pre-trained model (best_model.h5) within your notebooks as needed to perform predictions or further analysis.

Project Background
These projects illustrate my expertise in deep learning, demonstrating how neural networks can be applied to solve both classification and regression problems. The work emphasizes practical model development, from data preprocessing and architecture design to training and evaluation.
